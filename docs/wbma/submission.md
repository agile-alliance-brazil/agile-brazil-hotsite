## Proceedings


We are pleased to announce that the WBMA proceedings will be published in the Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) book series, a Springer Publication. We suggest that you check out previous proceedings of WBMA on SpringerLink, [https://link.springer.com/conference/wbma](https://link.springer.com/conference/wbma). 

Authors should consult Springer’s [authors’ guidelines](ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/svproc/guidelines/Springer_Guidelines_for_Authors_of_Proceedings.pdf) and use their proceedings templates, either for [LaTeX](ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/llncs2e.zip) or for [Word](ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/word/splnproc1703.zip), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their [ORCIDs](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid?wt_mc=Other.Other.1.AUT642.ORCID+proceedings+pilot+2017&utm_medium=other&utm_source=other&utm_content=8232017&utm_campaign=1_barz01_orcid+proceedings+pilot+2017) in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form (can be found (here)[]. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.
